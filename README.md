# Conditional Minimalist Form

### See the Form live [HERE](https://luc-constantin.github.io/conditional-form)

#### A modern and minimalist HTML form with conditional logic implemented using JavaScript. The form allows users to submit their name, email, phone number, city, device, device model, color, storage, and an optional message. 
#### The conditional logic in the form dynamically shows and hides input fields based on user selections.
----
#### The code is ready to be cloned or forked to set up the form on a web server. I invite you to extend or customize it to fit your specific requirements.
